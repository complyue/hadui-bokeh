# Haze - Bokeh visualization for interactive stack project

## Teaser

Haze will be a collection of cherry picked [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org)
features to fulfill internal demands from my team, for the first stage.

To get started fast, it's deviating from the strongly typed tradition
pursued by both Bokeh (it's in _TypeScript_ at the core) and Haskell,
for this stage. But may ultimately become a strongly typed binding of
[Bokeh](https://bokeh.org) for [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/),
that's unfortunately not for certain.
