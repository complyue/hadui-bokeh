# Haze - Bokeh visualization for interactive stack project

## Teaser

Haze will be a collection of cherry picked [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org)
features working as a
[Hadui](https://github.com/complyue/hadui)
[overlay package](https://github.com/complyue/hadui/wiki/OverlayPackage)
to fulfill internal demands from my team, for the first stage.

To get started fast, it's deviating from the strongly typed tradition
pursued by both Bokeh (written in _TypeScript_ at the core) and Haskell,
for this stage. But may ultimately become a strongly typed binding of
[Bokeh](https://bokeh.org) for [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).
That's however not for certain right now.
